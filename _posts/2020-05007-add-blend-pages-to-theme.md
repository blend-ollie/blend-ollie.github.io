### Overview

Cordova is an open-source mobile development framework. It allows you to use HTML5 to build mobile apps without having to use the mobile platforms native language.

For example, native iOS apps are built using Objective-C or Swift. Cordova allows you to build an app in HTML5, CSS, Javascript, etc. without having to use the iOS native languages and then compile the app to a device.

Another great feature when using Cordova is that you can compile to multiple platforms (e.g. iOS, Android, Windows) and work in only one codebase. It's really simple to do this too. Once you've created the app, if you wanted to compile to iOS, you'd run `cordova platform add ios`, or compile to Android with `cordova platform add android`.
